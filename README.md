# MetaPurge
MetaData remover 

Free your files of lurking ghosts.
MetaPurge purges your images, PDFs, and audio files of all metadata — because what cannot be seen can still bite.

What it does
Erases EXIF data on photos (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP)

Erases audio metadata (MP3, FLAC, WAV)

Removes PDF metadata

Copies unidentified files without metadata removal (better safe than sorry)

Why MetaPurge?
Your files might be leaking secrets — location, device details, edit history. MetaPurge cuts the strings so your files are bare files. No trackers, no crumbs.

Usage
Drag and drop your file onto the application or execute from command prompt:


It deletes in-place — no copies, no mess.

Installation
Run the installer and MetaPurge will get added to your right-click menu. Right-click on any supported file, select Strip Metadata, and let the cleanse all begin.

Requirements
Windows 10+

No admin rights needed (but recommended for shell integration)

Known Limits
Video metadata striping is limited — copies instead of cleans.

Some file types might have concealed metadata saved.
